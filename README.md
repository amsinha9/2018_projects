## Projects

### Brain Age

**Name**: Brain Age\
**Project url(s)**: [https://github.com/danielmlow/brain_age](https://github.com/danielmlow/brain_age)\
**Contributors**: [Julie Schneider](https://github.com/juliagoolia28), [Ali Cohen](https://github.com/alioco), [Danielle Sullivan](https://github.com/drsulliv3), [Daniel Low](https://github.com/danielmlow), [Shina Seabury](https://github.com/shinaburysea), [Rachel Mak-McCully](https://github.com/rmak15), [Michalis Kassinopoulos](https://github.com/mkassinopoulos), [Prokopis Prokopiou](https://github.com/prokopis)\
**Description of project**: How old is your brain? The current project implements Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict #brain-age from structural MRI and resting-state fMRI seperately in neurotypical and clinical populations.\
